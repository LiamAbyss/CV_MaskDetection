<u>Contributors</u> : Rémi ARBACHE, Paul BUCAMP, Eugénie DALMAS

The mask detection model has been trained a custom dataset with the notebook *data_creation.ipynb* and trained with the first cells of the *project.ipynb* notebook.

The detection can be tried in *project.ipynb* using the camera. A pre-trained model *svm_model* can be loaded.
